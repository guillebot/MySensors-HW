# Mysensors HW

Hi, this is Guillebot branch of the great @scalz work on mysensors hardware.

As I haven't been able to contact him, I'm putting here some small modifications on his great work regarding rollershutter controllers.

My setup is:

* OpenHAB (2.4)
* MQTT (mosquitto)
* Mysensors (2.3.1) with nRF24 radios.
